<h2>About Me:</h2>
<p>My name is Blake and this is my hellow world application into angular7  I really enjoy a lot of the features tha angular seven provides and I look forward to working with it in the future.  They really made http requests easy to deal with with the built in @angular/http so i'm happy about that.  The intentional built in routing with angular applications is super useful and helps narrow down the out there dependencies</p>
